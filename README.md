Data Visualization for the INC 5000 companies/industries

<bold>Conclusion:</bold>Conclusion: There are four dashboards. With different stories we came to conclusion that Advertising & Market had the highest growth followed by IT services with least growth in Environment Services and Computer Hardware. Also we saw that when we come across industries such as IT service we always think about New York and California. But we were surprised to see that maximum workers were in Georgia for IT services. So if we want to start our own venture the INC 5000 gives us the complete study of growth and revenues and what are our key competitors for which particular industry.
